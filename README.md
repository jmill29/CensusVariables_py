## Project Description
This is a fairly simple project that uses Python to preprocess and clean up data in a Dataframe (the data in
question is simulated census data meant to represent a small community in the U.S.). The primary objective
of this project is to portray the author's abilities in writing Python and using the Pandas library to
accomplish specific tasks. Tasks such as one-hot and label encoding, as well as the cleaning up and
modification of data for utilization in machine learning and data analysis.  

## Features
- Preprocessing of simulated U.S. census data for use in data analysis and possible machine learning.
    - By first replacing missing data with the appropriate data, and otherwise cleaning it (the data) up
    - And then converting the data to the appropriate datatype for the sake of using various functions
    and methods during the data analysis and machine learning process. <br>
- Basic analysis of the simulated U.S. census dataset.
    - Using the mean function to find the average birth year of the census respondents (<em>1973</em>)
    - and the median function to determine how the average respondent responded to the
    following statement: "The wealthy should pay higher taxes." (<em>Neutral</em>)
